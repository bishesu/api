Batch: Jan19D

These days the photography scene in Nepal is in a buzz, there are many talented local photographers in the country who aspire to achieve greatness through photography. Some even want photography as a part of their career with VIST NEPAL 2020 this has added more charm to photography then it already had. People post their photography in social medias and get a lot of recognition but sadly it is limited to that for most of the local photographers furthermore there are no legitimate website like Pexels.com, unsplash.com, canva.com and many more in the country that is simply dedicated to promoting photographers and helping them make a career through online photography. Thus, my project aims to rectify this situation
